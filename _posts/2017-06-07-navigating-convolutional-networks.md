Convolutional networks has been the buzz in the deep learning community 
for quite some time now. However, deploying such systems in a production 
environment is a different thing altogether. Recently, I'm had to deal with 
such a project related to object detection in images and so I decided to 
refresh my knowledge about CNNs. There's a plethora of literature on CNNs but 
I beleive it's always frustrating to know where to start. I went through couple 
of notes and papers to refine my understanding about CNNs and so I felt the need 
to share these resources that got me up and running in three days.


## Basics
Learn about convolutions and the CNN architecture from Christopher Olah's blog. 
Understanding convolutions{% sidenote 1 'Physical world analogy in [Colahâ€™s post on convolutions](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-Understanding-Convolutions/)'%}
is important because they are at the heart of CNNs. Olah also vividly explains
the CNN architecture {% sidenote 2 'Modular approach to [CNN architectural setup](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-Conv-Nets-Modular/)'%}
